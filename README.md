For this lab the important thing to note is we included 2 moore_fsm modules since we modifed the moore machine to implement a debounced input. So we named one file moore_FSM_OG.v and one file moore_FSM.v. 

The OG moore machine file does not use debounced input and the other one does use a debounced input. We managed to run this on the FPGA as well using debounced buttons.
